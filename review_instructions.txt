Review focus:
- Correctness, logic bugs, missed edge cases.
- Performance issues (time/space), unnecessary work.
- Security concerns, input validation, secrets, unsafe patterns.
- Maintainability: clarity, naming, duplication, dead code.
- API and behavior changes: breaking changes, backwards compat.
- Tests: additions/updates needed, gaps.
- Style consistency with existing codebase.

Output format:
- Then list issues grouped by severity: Blocker, Major, Minor, Nit.
- Quote small code excerpts when helpful.
- Provide concrete suggestions.
